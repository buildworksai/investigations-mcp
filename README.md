## Quick Start

### Basic Investigation Workflow

1. **Start an Investigation**
```bash
investigation_start \
  --title "API Performance Issue" \
  --description "Response times increased significantly" \
  --severity high \
  --category performance \
  --reported-by "monitoring-system"
```

2. **Collect Evidence**
```bash
investigation_collect_evidence \
  --investigation-id "inv_001" \
  --sources '[
    {
      "type": "logs",
      "path": "/var/log/app.log",
      "time_range": {
        "start": "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
        "end": "2024-01-15T16:00:00Z"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "metrics",
      "parameters": {
        "metrics": ["cpu", "memory", "disk"]
      }
    }
  ]'
```

3. **Analyze Evidence**
```bash
investigation_analyze_evidence \
  --investigation-id "inv_001" \
  --analysis-type timeline \
  --hypothesis "Database connection pool exhaustion"
```

4. **Generate Report**
```bash
investigation_generate_report \
  --investigation-id "inv_001" \
  --format markdown \
  --include-evidence true
```
