## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Package Installation Failures
If you encounter installation errors, try these steps in order:

```bash
# 1. Clear npm and npx caches
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx

# 2. Verify Node.js version (requires 18+)
node --version

# 3. Try alternative installation methods
npm install -g buildworks-ai-investigations-mcp@latest
# OR
npx buildworks-ai-investigations-mcp@latest --version
```

#### ENOTEMPTY Error with npx
This is a common npm cache corruption issue. The package includes automatic detection and guidance:

```bash
# Clear npm and npx cache
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx

# Or use the provided script
./scripts/clear-npx-cache.sh
```

#### SQLite3 Native Module Issues
If you encounter `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` or similar native module errors, ensure you're using version 2.0.13 or later, which uses `better-sqlite3` for improved compatibility.

#### Crypto Deprecation Warnings
If you see warnings about deprecated `crypto@1.0.1` package, ensure you're using version 2.0.15 or later, which uses Node.js built-in crypto module instead.

#### MCP Server Connection Issues
If you encounter "failed to initialize server" or "transport error: server terminated" errors:

1. **Check version**: Ensure you're using version 2.0.23 or later
2. **Clear corrupted cache** (MOST COMMON FIX):
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx
   npx buildworks-ai-investigations-mcp@latest --version
   ```
3. **Verify installation**: Test with `npx buildworks-ai-investigations-mcp@latest --version`
4. **Check Node.js**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed

#### better-sqlite3 Native Module Errors
If you see errors mentioning `better_sqlite3.node`, `bindings.js`, or "failed to initialize server":

**Root Cause**: Corrupted npx cache with incomplete native module installation

**Solution** (Required):
```bash
# Clear all caches
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx

# Fresh installation
npx buildworks-ai-investigations-mcp@latest --version
```

**Prevention**: The package now includes automatic detection of corrupted cache in v2.0.23+

#### "No tools" in MCP Client
If your MCP client shows "No tools, prompts, or resources":

1. **Verify server startup**: Check that the server starts without errors
2. **Check MCP configuration**: Ensure correct command and args in your MCP config
3. **Test manually**: Run `echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | npx buildworks-ai-investigations-mcp@latest`
4. **Restart client**: Restart your MCP client after configuration changes
