## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Package Installation Failures
If you encounter installation errors, try these steps in order:

```bash
# 1. Clear npm and npx caches
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx

# 2. Verify Node.js version (requires 18+)
node --version

# 3. Try alternative installation methods
npm install -g investigations@latest
# OR
npx investigations@latest --version
```

#### ENOTEMPTY Error with npx
This is a common npm cache corruption issue. The package includes automatic detection and guidance:

```bash
# Clear npm and npx cache
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx
```

#### Storage System
The application uses JSON-based file storage for maximum compatibility. All data is stored in the `./.investigations/` directory with automatic FIFO management.

#### Crypto Deprecation Warnings
If you see warnings about deprecated `crypto@1.0.1` package, ensure you're using version 2.2.2 or later, which uses Node.js built-in crypto module instead.

#### MCP Server Connection Issues
If you encounter "failed to initialize server" or "transport error: server terminated" errors:

1. **Check version**: Ensure you're using version 2.2.2 or later
2. **Clear corrupted cache** (MOST COMMON FIX):
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx
   npx investigations@latest --version
   ```
3. **Verify Node.js version**: Ensure you're using Node.js 18 or higher
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should show v18.x.x or higher
   ```
4. **Check NODE_MODULE_VERSION compatibility**:
   ```bash
   node -p "process.versions.modules"  # Should match your Node.js version
   ```
5. **Fresh installation**:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g investigations
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx
   npm install -g investigations@latest
   ```

#### Native Module Issues (Resolved)
The application now uses JSON-based file storage, eliminating all native module compatibility issues. No more NODE_MODULE_VERSION or better-sqlite3 errors!


#### "No tools" in MCP Client
If your MCP client shows "No tools, prompts, or resources":

1. **Verify server startup**: Check that the server starts without errors
2. **Check MCP configuration**: Ensure correct command and args in your MCP config
3. **Test manually**: Run `echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | npx investigations@latest`
4. **Restart client**: Restart your MCP client after configuration changes
