## Implementation Highlights

### 🎯 **Forensic Methodology**
- **Evidence-Based**: No conclusions without supporting evidence
- **Systematic Approach**: Structured investigation workflow
- **Chain of Custody**: Detailed audit trail for all evidence
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate theories against collected evidence
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quantify analysis confidence levels

### 🔒 **Security & Compliance**
- **Data Integrity**: Checksums and validation for all evidence
- **Access Control**: Proper permissions and authentication
- **Audit Logging**: Complete operation logging
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Compliance Ready**: Meets forensic investigation standards

### ⚡ **Performance & Scalability**
- **Parallel Collection**: Efficient evidence gathering
- **Caching**: Analysis result caching
- **Incremental Updates**: Handle large investigations
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and optimize resource usage
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization

## Example Investigation Workflow

### 1. **API Performance Issue**
```
investigation_start → collect_evidence → analyze_evidence → 
trace_causality → validate_hypothesis → document_findings → 
generate_report
```

**Result**: Identified database connection pool exhaustion as root cause with 91.2% confidence

### 2. **Security Incident**
```
investigation_start → collect_security_evidence → analyze_security → 
trace_attack_vector → validate_threat_hypothesis → document_findings → 
generate_security_report
```

**Result**: Detected coordinated brute force attack with detailed timeline and recommendations

## Best Practices Implemented
